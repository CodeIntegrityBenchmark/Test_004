# Test_004
This project is part of a benchmark / test suite used to check the different git histories created through different development processes.
The test suite is meant to be processed by [SPHA-Code-Integrity](https://github.com/fraunhofer-iem/SPHA-Code-Integrity).

## Textual description
Expected commits that are against integrity rules: 
* initial commit
* commit updating the readme
* intermediate commit after creating the feature branch

create feature branch, do one commit on the branch, do one commit on the main branch, merge it back (use merge commit).

This change was made directly to the main branch.
